# MindBodyGo

Automation software I created to book swimming lanes, workout bays, and more at an athletic club that opens up the booking at 4:45 AM. You type in login information, and information about what you would want to reserve. Then hit go and the program waits until 4:45 AM the next day, then emulates the browser's requests and completes the booking. Involves gathering cookies and various identifiers throughout the process.
